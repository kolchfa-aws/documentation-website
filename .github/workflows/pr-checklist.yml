            Thank you for submitting your PR. The PR states are Tech review -> Doc review -> Editorial review. 
            ### PR checklist
            - [ ] Tech review: 
              - If you're a developer submitting documentation for a feature you implemented, you can skip this step.
              - If you need a tech review, tag @kolchfa-aws.
            - [ ] Tech reviewer: Tag @kolchfa-aws once the tech review is done.
            - [ ] Doc review: A doc reviewer may:
              - Leave comments/suggestions: You will implement comments. Add suggestions to a batch and commit the batch as one commit.
              - Edit the PR: The doc reviewer will push edits to this PR directly (let us know if you don't want this option).
            - [ ] Editorial review: The doc reviewer will put the PR through editorial review.

            Please be available to answer questions. Thank you!
